# PyMQTT-IOT-project
This project was done by me when studying Advanced Internet security.


An attempt to use the Raspberry Pi with attached
camera as a barcode scanner connected to a inventory logging
system. The use of mosquitto MQTT provides greater security,
while sending client data to the server.
